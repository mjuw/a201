Our goal at Massage by Tia is to provide a quiet retreat in Philadelphia where you can think you've traveled to a far-off place surrounded by lush and tropical vegetation.
Our spacious massage room hs its own distinct feel with special care given to providing a unique session to meet the needs of the individual client.
Our tables are heated, provide soft padding for comfort, and we use the best linens available in the business today.

Our therapists maintain their professional knowledge and Pennsylvania State License by attending local and regional certified and advanced training classes in the art of massage.
